<p><strong>BoI | Definition: Noun, Battery of Internets</strong> (Because you always wanted to connect a battery to the internet)</p>
<p>Welcome to the Internet of Batteries: DEF CON 28 Edition! We're back for our 2nd year after being told that the SAO standard &quot;doesn't support&quot; a battery back-powering the circuit on the VCC. Last year we successfully brought you a badge/add-on hybrid to support powering devices through both FEMALE and MALE headers, and this year we've iterated on that concept to bring you an updated model including a Cypress PSOC5, RGB, MORE LEDs, MORE colors, MORE  capacity, MORE CLOUD, and an updated version of our WiFi mesh network to enable Safe Mode w/ Networking.</p>
<p>This badge is compatable with SAO 1.69bis, though if plugged in to any other DC badge it could cause aliens to show up with ships that hang in the sky in much the same way bricks don't.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a WiFi Mesh Network (Itero) which powers the IoB. Through this network you can send broadcast messages to one big group chat, or sent PMs to up to 25 added devices. To scan for available nodes in the area, add other batteries to your &quot;friends&quot; list, and interact with group &amp; private chat, you will need to connect to the <strong>Captive Arcade<sup>TM</sup></strong>. When connected, &quot;Friends&quot; and scanned nodes will show green.</p>
<p>To view power usage statistics users connect to the <strong>Captive Arcade<sup>TM</sup></strong> on the ESP32 to view local battery power consumption and discharge stats.</p>
<h2 id="jump-start">Jump Start</h2>
<ol start="0">
<li>WASH YOUR HANDS (ya filthy animal)</li>
<li>Power switch ON (Does NOT need to be on to charge this year)</li>
<li>If LEDs flash RGB on boot, boi is in low voltage mode, charge it</li>
<li>Hold &quot;DEF&quot; capsense button on boot = force low voltage mode = faster charge</li>
<li>Hold &quot;TOUCH SLIDER&quot; capsense button area on boot = factory reset</li>
<li>Solder headers (make sure to orient to VCC on the SQUARE pad)</li>
<li>Show off in #linecon (<a href="http://discord.gg/DEFCON">discord.gg/DEFCON</a>)</li>
<li>See you @ DEFCON 29!</li>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<h3 id="tech-specs">Tech Specs:</h3>
<ul>
<li>ESP32 WiFi Battery Processor</li>
<li>PSoC5 LP analog / lightshow / comms controller</li>
<li>INA199 current sense, capable of 750mA peak sense</li>
<li>Very rushed hardware and firmware engineered by total hacks</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-does-it-all-do">What does it all do?</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is a badge...or is it an add-on?</li>
<li>In badge mode, measures total current of add-ons and logs power consumption</li>
<li>In add-on mode, measures its own current</li>
<li>Is capable of back-powering a badge through the add-on header**</li>
<li>RGB lights show useful information or fun light shows</li>
<li>Touch sensors to activate battery gauge, light show, and backpower enabling modes</li>
<li>Other indicator lights show power enable status and low battery*</li>
<li>For 2020 we're in Safe Mode with Networking. The old WiFi mesh, Itero, has been upgraded to be more global... the IoB is IoT!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Low battery indicator / shutoff mode not yet implemented. Will require MCU FW update to enable.
** ALL RISKS OF BACKPOWERING ARE TAKEN BY YOU. NOT LIABLE FOR ANY FIRES, DAMAGE, INTERNET WORMS, BLACK HOLES, OR ANYTHING ELSE GOOD OR BAD AS A RESULT OF USING THIS FEATURE</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="better-instructions">Better Instructions</h2>
<ul>
<li>NOTE: If the battery voltage is TOO LOW when powered on, the LEDS will flash RGB then go dark and output current battery voltage on serial out (115200). Once above 3.7v the battery should show animation while charging after rebooting</li>
</ul>
<p>There are FIVE buttons on the DC27 version of the Internet of Batteries:</p>
